== How to create a test certificate ==

Install the .net SDK (for makecert and signtool)
In theory, it should also work with openssl >= 0.9.9, but I have 0.9.8 everywhere and 1.0.0beta didn't compile.

On an SDK prompt, type

makecert -r -pe -ss TestCertStoreName -n "CN=SDK Test Certificate" -sv testcert.pvk testcert.cer


PASSPHRASE => The checked in testcert.pvk has the passphrase "test"

== How to sign a binary ==

These are the steps I took to create a test signature. You need test certificate (.cer from above), test private key (.pvk from above) and the binary to sign.

signtool signwizard

* Choose the .exe to sign
* Next
* Choose Custom
* Next
* Choose "Select From File", select testcert.cer
* Next
* Browse..., select testcert.pvk
* Next
* Enter passphrase
* Choose hash algorithm. Tested with sha1.
* Next
* Next
* Enter something for description and web location
* Next
* Next
* Finish
