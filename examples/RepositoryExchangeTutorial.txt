To exchange an online repository during update process do the following steps.

1. navigate to the source folder of installerbase ( from trunk this is installerbuilder/installerbase )
2. open the installerbase.qrc and add an entry pointing to overrideconfig.xml
3. copy the config.xml file in the installerbase source folder rename it to overrideconfig.xml
4. rebuild installerbase

The override config is now shipped with the installerbase.exe and always overrides the old given config until
a new installerbase.exe is shipped without this resource.
